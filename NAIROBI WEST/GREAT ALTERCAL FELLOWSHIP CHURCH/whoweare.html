        <div class="we_p"><p>GAF Church is a vibrant Christian community committed to spreading the true gospel of Jesus Christ. The church has established the Nairobi West Diocese, which encompasses several branches, including Gomongo Church, Dandora Church, and Mombasa Church. Under the leadership of Bishop Benard Okalo, along with the guidance of the elders, the Nairobi West Diocese aims to create a nurturing environment for believers, where they can grow in their faith and serve the Lord. The church is dedicated to preaching the word of God, reaching out to communities, and making a positive impact in the lives of individuals and families through the transformative power of the gospel.

            In addition to its spiritual mission, GAF Church places a strong emphasis on community development, education, and outreach programs, believing that true faith is demonstrated through service to others. The church works tirelessly to foster unity, support the less fortunate, and provide a platform for believers to live out their Christian values in every aspect of life. Through prayer, fellowship, and discipleship, GAF Church seeks to empower individuals to walk in the light of Christ, making a lasting difference in both the local and global communities.</p>
